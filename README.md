# What is this for?
This small repo contains a collection of scripts documented on [CTT](https://dsc.gg/CTT). 
# Script overview
- Install script for my [toolbox](https://github.com/couleurm/couleurstoolbox)
- Install script for LCL (fast launcher for Lunar Client, keeps your OptiFine settings when you switch versions)
  * LCLI.bat contains a settings patcher for Optifine
  * LCLI+.bat contains no settings patcher for Optifine but rather gives the user the ability to specify directories for 1.7-1.8 and 1.12-1.17  
  (Patcher Support was removed since it wasn't working with multi directory support added in LCLI+.bat)
- Install script for PRB (Automated installer/profile setup of portable OBS 25.0.8, oriented for easy use of the Replay Buffer feature)
- FFmpeg scripts
